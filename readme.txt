Dependencies:
    Tested with Ubuntu 20.04
    ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy
    Python 3
    Gazebo

    ROS 2 Foxy Packages:
        rclpy
        turtlebot3
        turtlebot3_msgs
        turtlebot3_simulations
        sensor_msgs

        std_srvs
        

    Python 3 Packages:
        numpy
        keras
        tensorflow - GPU support isn't necessary but advised for faster Deep Q-Learning training (instructions: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu )
        gym
        transformations

How to test:
    Install Python packages using pip

    Install ROS2 Foxy
    Create ~/ros2_ws folder
    Create src folder inside ros2_ws
    Install ROS2 packages
    Copy repository to ~/ros2_ws/src folder

    Add the following commands to ~/.bashrc:
        - source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
        - source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
        - export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:~/ros2_ws/src/turtlebot3/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/models:~/ros2_ws/src/robot_hide_seek/models
        - export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
        - export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=30 #TURTLEBOT3

    Change directory to ~/ros2_ws/src/robot_hide_seek
    Execute:
        $ chmod +x *.sh

    To build the package, run:
        $ ./build.sh

    To run the simulation:
        $ ./run_sim.sh

        Simulation can be run at real-world speed by doing the following in worlds/*.model:
            Comment "<real_time_update_rate>0</real_time_update_rate>"
            Change "<max_step_size>0.01</max_step_size>" to "<max_step_size>0.001</max_step_size>"
            Uncomment "<real_time_factor>1</real_time_factor>"

        Otherwise, simulation will run at ~15x real-world speed (to train faster)

    To run game:
        $ ./run_game.sh

        Constant GAME_USES_TRAINING in utils.py defines whether the robots should use Deep Q-Learn training results (when True) or basic AI (when False)

    To train using Q-Learning:
        Training results are loaded when training starts.
        To train from scrath replace training_results/hiders.txt or training_results/seekers.txt content with '{}'.

        For hider:
            $ ./train_hider.sh

        For seeker:
            $ ./train_seeker.sh

        GAME_USES_TRAINING should be set to False

    To train using Deep Q-Learning:
        Training results are loaded when training starts.
        To train from scrath delete training_results/hider or training_results/seeker folders.

        For hider:
            $ ./deeptrain_hider.sh

        For seeker:
            $ ./deeptrain_seeker.sh

        GAME_USES_TRAINING should be set to False
